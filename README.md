# Salesforce-LWC-JunctionBuilder
A Lightning Web Component that allows for quickly adding multiple junction records to an existing record page

I recommend using the standard "Related List - Single" component immediately above this component (as seen in the screenshot). This way, users can see which junction records already exist and will immediately see the new ones they create after the component saves the new records.
